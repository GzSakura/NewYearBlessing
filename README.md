# Sakura - New Year Blessing Bomb 🧧

A high-performance, minimalist New Year blessing engine designed to deliver a massive "burst" of unique greetings directly to the user's screen.

## 🚀 The Philosophy (Linus Style)

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code." This project isn't about fancy frameworks or over-engineered bloat. It's about raw performance, data integrity, and a "good taste" UI.

- **Zero Wait**: No welcome screens, no useless buttons. Load the page, get the blessings. Immediately.
- **Data Integrity**: Uses a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to ensure every single blessing is unique. No duplicates, no collisions.
- **Infinite Stack**: No arbitrary cleanup. The blessings pile up like real-world red envelopes, creating a high-density visual impact.
- **Spartan Design**: Minimalist window-style UI inspired by classic desktop environments.

## 🛠️ Technical Features

- **Burst Engine**: Delivers 20 unique pop-up windows per second until the entire blessing pool is drained.
- **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**: Pre-shuffles hundreds of unique Chinese New Year greetings to ensure non-repeating delivery.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. No React, no Vue, no garbage.
- **Draggable Windows**: Each blessing window is a separate DOM element with basic drag-and-drop support.

## 📦 How to Run
